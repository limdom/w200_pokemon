Project 1 is like climbing your first cliff after weeks of wall climbing; Git + GitHub are your tether line.

    "One of the most important things you should do when you are working on your project is to put the files where they are expected to be found conventionally. As covered previously, developers like yourself build functionality into logically grouped packages called `modules`. By doing so, we make the entire project easier to read, maintain, and add to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python applications typically follow a format like so: \n",

    "```\n",
    "my-project/\n",
    "|-- my-project/\n",
    "|   |-- main.py\n",
    "|   |   \n",
    "|   |-- submodule_1/\n",
    "|   |   |-- something.py\n",
    "|   |   |-- thing1.py\n",
    "|   |   |-- thing2.py\n",
    "|   |   \n",

Some developers like to use `src`, whichever is fine. Underneath the source directory is a `main.py`, which is the entrypoint of the application and all supporting submodules. This structure is very clear and easy to maintain! Let's look at it in context of a simple Slack bot for [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) questions, called `leetbot`. \n",

The slack_client is responsible for interfacing with the Slack session via API. This all comes together to post a Leetcode question to a specified channel every day. If you were hired to work on this bot, and were asked to change the slack message format, where would you look first? Probably in the `slack_client` module! \n",

Well, you could try to look in the submodules but you might get lost in some of the implementation details. It would likely be more efficient to begin at the beginning! This is why a lot of modules opt to use a `main.py` or similar. `main.py` can be called quite a few things, like `program.py` or the name of the program itself (`my-project.py` or `leetbot.py` from above).

You'll notice on the bottom, the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block calls the `main()` method, executes it, and uses the return value as the script exit code. Without knowing what it's doing though, one can immediately recognize that the program starts at `if __name__ == '__main__':`, and can continue to trace it out. Another consequence of using `if __name__ == '__main__':` is that the code will only run if the script is called. If `echo.py` is imported, nothing in `if __name__ == '__main__':` will run! Meaning you can safely import functions without worrying about (potentially catestrophic) side effects. Creating a function called main() will allow you to also import/test it elsewhere.

    "Core loop is a term that comes from game development. I like to use it to describe, in essence, your program's flow from start to finish. Sure, certain user choices might dramatically alter how they interact with your program. More often than not, however, the overarching program can be expressed in a `main()` method. For simple scripts and programs, it's trivial to write the core loop in the `main.py` file such that the program's entry point and nominal exit point are present, with the intermediary steps enumerated between them. This is also a great place to create and transform objects, pass arguments between them, get return values, etc. For simple programs I also like to keep all `print()` calls in the `main()` method so that there's no UI dependencies anywhere else. \n",

    "* [Comment](https://www.askpython.com/python/python-comments) your code WELL. Not only will this pay dividents while working on the project, it's a major part of your grade. \n",
    "* Follow the [PEP-8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), especially for naming conventions. You can ignore the 80 character line limit (160-200 is fine).\n",
    "* Consider running your code through a linter like pylint or flake8. This can often be done [inside a modern IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting).\n",
